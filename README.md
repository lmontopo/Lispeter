This is a Scheme Interpreter written in Python.  I used unit testing for my tests.
The Interpreter interprets lists along with car and cdr, define expressions, basic math, the factorial function denoted by '!', basic boolean logic, 
set! expressions, let expressions, lambdas, begin!, map, and quote. 

ENJOY!
